This App:
<br>Uses a professionally designed Bootstrap 4 "Blog" theme from https://bootstrapious.com.
<br>Uses data from back-end API to manage the blog posts in an existing MongoDB Atlas account.
<br>Includes the ability to create new posts as well as edit / delete existing posts, allow users to comment on posts and track the number of "views" per post.
